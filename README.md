SQL Alchemy challenge

Description:

A SQLAlchemy and Python Flask challenge, completed when requested to obtain climate data for a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii.

Instructions for use:

        1. Ensure you have downloaded and installed Jupyter Notebook, and know how to use the Flask module.
        
        If not, you can find this at:
        https://jupyter.org/install and https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/installation/.
        
        Please refer to the instructions on how to use the two on the above websites.

        2. Download the 'Resources' and 'SurfsUp' directories within this repository to the same folder or location on your local drive.

        3. Load Jupyter Notebook from your terminal in the path where you have downloaded these two folders.

        4. Use the newly opened Jupyter Notebook to locate the 'climate_starter.ipynb' file, open it, and run all cells. This is where you will see the analysis.

        5. Then, open your terminal again and navigate into the 'SurfsUp' folder you have just downloaded.

        6. Open the app.py using the command: <i> python app.py </i>

        7. You are now ready to use the flask app, created to return the json data from my analysis. It should say the below:

            Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
            
        8. Press Ctrl + left click on the http:// link. Follow the instructions on the newly opened page to view the data as json returns.

The first charts in the 'climate_starter.ipynb' file shows which months the precipitation is the highest or lowest, so you can make a decision on when you want to travel to Honolulu.

The second chart shows that temperatures in the region of 75 degrees Fahrenheit are most common in Honolulu.
